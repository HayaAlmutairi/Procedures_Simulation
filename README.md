# Simulating_Procedures
This project aims to investigate the performance of the parametric and nonparametric tests used  to compare groups. And how it affects type I error and Type II error (Power).
These tests are Analysis of variance (ANOVA), Welch test, and Kruskal-Wallis test. Each one will be testing on a random sample from different distributions (normal, t-test, and chi-square).

The objectives of this research are to discuss how much type of distribution and sample size effect the Type I error and the power for each procedure. Compare the estimation of the type 1 error and power using figures, then Illustrate which procedure has the highest power, which help to select the appropriate procedure in any statistical analysis.
